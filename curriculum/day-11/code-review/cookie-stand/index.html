    <h2> The Pat's Impressive Story (About Us) </h2>
      <p><strong> <q>Seattle is to cookie, as coffee is to salmon</q> </strong></p>
      <p> Boom. Mind Blown. Am I right??? I know... </p>
      <p> I, Pat, the Patness came up with THIS wonderful confection: </p>
      <img src="assets/frosted-cookie.jpg" alt="yummy cookie"/>

      <p><strong> Smoky. Fishy. Sweet. Deliicous. </strong></p>
      <p> Yummy!! Am I Right??? I know... </p>
      <p> Yup that's the Patster what I thought too. </p>
      <p><strong> Here they are ... my little bundels of fishy goodness. </strong></p>
      <img src="assets/fish.jpg" alt="colorful fish cookies probably laced with something secret, shhhhh"/>

      <p><strong> My pride and joy. </strong></p>
      <hr><p> But you are probably asking yourself... </p>
      <p> ...just how does el Patrino make these? Am I Right??? I know... </p>
      <p><strong> Well, wonder no more. </strong></p>
      <p> We take a raw hand caught salmon, like this one... </p>

      <p><strong> ...and grind it all up. Mix it with the secret dough recipe... </strong></p>
      <p> ...cut the dough using this hand smelted cutter by world famous Kim Bj√∂rklund... </p>
